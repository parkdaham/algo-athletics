# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement User Registration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Simplify the user registration feature to include only a 'Verify Identity' button.
# Details:
Create a user interface with a single button labeled 'Verify Identity'. This button will simulate the completion of the registration process. No backend API is required. Focus on the UI component that triggers the identity verification step.

# Test Strategy:
Perform UI testing to ensure the 'Verify Identity' button is displayed correctly and functions as expected. Verify that the button simulates the registration completion process.
